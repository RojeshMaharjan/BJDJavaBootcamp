Module Requirement Gathering

Day-1: Module -Requirement Gathering :
Scope of the Insurance Management System:
The insurance management system aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing various aspects of an insurance company's operations. The system will be built as a set of microservices using Java, Spring MVC, Spring Microservices, and Spring Cloud. It will be deployed on AWS EC2 instances, and the API endpoints will be documented using Swagger.
The main modules of the system include:
Policy Management: Create, update, and retrieve insurance policies.
Claims Processing: Handle insurance claims, process claims, and track their status.
User Management: Manage user accounts, roles, and permissions.
Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and provide analytics on insurance policies and claims.
Security: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data privacy and system security.
Requirements Gathering:
Policy Management:
The system should allow the creation of new insurance policies with unique policy numbers, policy holder names, and premium amounts.
Policies should have an effective start date and an optional end date.
Users should be able to update policy details, such as the policy holder's name and premium amount.
The system should support retrieving policy details by policy ID and listing all existing policies.
Claims Processing:
Users should be able to create new insurance claims associated with specific policies.
Claims should have a unique claim number, a description of the claim, and the date of the incident.
The system should allow processing of claims, including setting the claim status (e.g., open, in progress, clo
sed) and adding relevant comments.
Users should be able to view and update the status of existing claims.
User Management:
The system should support user registration, allowing new users to sign up with their details.
Users should be able to log in with their credentials and receive an access token for authentication.
The system should have multiple user roles (e.g., admin, manager, agent) with different permissions for accessing and modifying data.


Reporting and Analytics:
The system should generate various reports, such as a list of all policies, claims by status, and policy statistics.
Reports should be accessible to authorized users in a downloadable format (e.g., PDF, CSV).
The system should provide analytics on policy trends, claim patterns, and other relevant insights.
Security:
User passwords should be securely hashed and stored in the database.
API endpoints should be secured with JWT-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
Users should be authorized based on their roles to access specific functionalities.
Swagger Documentation:
The API endpoints for each microservice should be thoroughly documented using Swagger annotations.
The Swagger documentation should include detailed information about request/response data and error handling.
Deployment on AWS EC2: or Deployment on Docker or Kubernetes
The microservices should be deployed on separate AWS EC2 instances to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
Load balancers should be set up to distribute incoming traffic among instances.
